Please, read all the following content before contribuint, specially if you're considering coding new features. It is important to have a common language, usage, and pattern between all the the code we develop for this repository.

This document is organized in sections. Each section explains a type of possible contribution.

## üßê Suggesting issues

It is a common misconception thinking that the "only way to contribute is throught coding". Creating issues and helping us identify bugs and other relevant questions is as valuable as adding code to our database.

Below, we've listed a couple of ways you can help us by creating issues to our team of contributors.

### Reporting bugs

It's complicated to ensure quality and prevent unexpected bugs. There are so many corner cases that is impossible to prevent bugs from happening. So, one of the most important contributions you can give us is reporting issues and bugs.

Reporting bugs is not a simple task. Is not a simple "feedback form" where you can just type what happened and we will evaluate. While reporting bugs you need to keep in mind that **we need to reproduce your issue**, so, we need as much information you can give us.

We [have a `bug-report` template][temmplate-bug-report] that you can use while reporting a bug (you can select it while writting your issue). Please, fill all the sections while doing so.

### Proposing features

Our system is only useful if it does what our users want. A huge part of our job is to prioritize the most relevant feature requests to code.

You can contribute to us by adding new issues with [the `feature-request` template][template-feature-request], where you can explain your idea, and what you want our system to solve that is not currently being solved yet.

Although our primary focus is in our users, keep in mind that some proposed features could be either too complex, or not even related to our primary domain. So, creating a feature request has no guarantee that it would be developed by our team.

## üë©‚Äçüíª Coding

Our team has limited resources, and we appreciate any developer that wants to helps us! Contributing to open-source is an amazing way to improve your technical skills and meet amazing people. Feel free to create pull requests fixing bugs, adding features or even solving tech debts.
